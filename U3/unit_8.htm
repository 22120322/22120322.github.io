<h2>Unit 8</h2>



<p>A - Understand the characteristics and uses of mobile apps</p>

<p>I was asked to review two different kind of mobile
 app and to prepare a short report which include: an explanation
 of the intended use and features of them; a review of features
 they have and discussion
 of the strengths and weaknesses of them.</p>

<p>B - Design a mobile app</p>


<p>I was asked to create a design for interactive app,
 that will help children between 3 & 7 years old to learn the alphabet.
 User interface should be appealing to this age range and simple to use.
 The app need to help the users recognise
 the shapes and sounds of letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>C - Develop and test a mobile app</p>

<p>
The development process include creating a multi-screen interface which 
demonstrates an awareness of the user requirements and intended purpose of the 
app. The app is multifunctional. I edited defended codes and developed some 
original codes to fulfill the design requirements of the app. I tested the app 
for functionality and purpose and repaired all the found faults.</p>
<p>
D - Review the finished mobile app</p>
<p>
I reviewed why the app is suitable for the <span lang="en-gb"></span>user requirements; for the 
target 
audience and for the intended purpose. I explained how the testing, the user 
feedback and the constraints have affected the suitability of the app. I 
justified all the changes I have made, while I evaluated my initial design and the 
completed app.</p>
<p>
<strong>Unit grade - Pass</strong></p>
<p>
I learned how mobile apps are developed. I learned how to design and set blocks with 
codes to make my app works. I used predefined codes, I change some of them to 
make them suitable for my design and even builded my own. I enjoyed this unit, 
while 
learning how to create apps that I thought I only can use. </p>
