<h2>Learning aim A</p>

<p>Computer and technology systems</p>

<h2>Understand how the components of technology systems
work together</h2>


<ul>
  <li>a computer is a machine that processes digital data</li>
  <li> a technology system is the complete collection of components (hardware, software,
peripherals, power supplies, communication links) making up a single computer
installation.</li>
  <li> application of technology systems used in different sectors, including construction,
finance, health, manufacturing (including CAD/CAM/use of robots) and retail</li>
  <li> reasons why future development of a technology system is important to
organisations, including competitive advantage, reduced costs and improved
performance.</li>
  <li> devices (PC, server, laptop, tablet, games console and other programmable digital
devices)</li>
  <li> output – printers (inkjet, laser, impact), speakers, force feedback devices, actuators,
screens, projectors, robot arms, other control devices</li>
  <li> that modern technology devices are often multifunctional (have both input and
output functionality)</li>
  <li>how hardware components and software can be combined to form an automated
technology system (self-service checkout, production line)</li>
  <li> suitable devices to suit the requirements for a specific user and purpose, and justify
their use.</li>
</ul>  


<h2>Learning aim B: Understand how data flows between internal components of a
computer and is processed to provide information</h2>




<ul>
  <li>the motherboard – printed circuit board (PCB) holding main components of
the system</li>
  <li> central processing unit (CPU) – arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), control unit, registers</li>
  <li> memory (RAM, ROM, including Flash memory)</li>
  <li>graphics/sound/video hardware </li>
  <li> heat dispersal systems – fans and heat sinks</li>
  <li> storage devices – solid state, optical and magnetic</li>
  <li> comparing how mobile systems are different from traditional platforms</li>
  <li>the role of computer buses in carrying data between the internal components of
a computer.</li>
  <li>the need to convert analogue signals to digital signals and digital signals to
analogue signals</li>
</ul>
