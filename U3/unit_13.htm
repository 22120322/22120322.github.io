<h2>Unit 13</h2>


<p>
A - Understand the uses and features of the websites</p>
<p>
I was asked to investigate two websites and proper a report that explain the 
uses of them and the intended purpose of their features. To review how the 
features of the both websites improve the presentation, usability and 
accessibility of the two websites.</p>
<p>
B - Design a website</p>
<p>
I was asked to create a design for an interactive website with main focus to 
promote mobile phones, accessories and services. The website should target 
anyone who is interested in buying mobile phones. The website should load easy 
and quick, to be easy to navigate and to contain interactive features.</p>
<p>
C - Develop and test a website</p>
<p>
The development process include creating interactive website following the 
approved design and refining the website to improve accessibility and 
performance, taking account of the user feedback and test results. I add an 
interactive feature to the website using simple client-side script which add 
functionality and aid usability. In the documentation I explained how my website 
fulfill the purpose that was defined within the design.</p>
<p>
D - Review the finished website</p>
<p>
I reviewed how the website is suitable for the user requirements; for the target 
audience and for the intended purpose. I explained how the testing, the user 
feedback and the constraints have affected the suitability of the website. I 
justified all changes I have made, while I evaluated my initial designs and the 
completed website.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
<strong>Unit grade - Pass</strong></p>
<p>
I learned how to design, develop and test a website. I learned what features of 
website looks like and work, also how to create them. I learned basic skills about how html 
works, even I create few web pages in part of the exercises we have done in the 
course. I am familiar with how to add basic java script in to website that I 
develop in Web Expression 4. I enjoyed this unit as I learned many things I never 
knew I can do.</p>
